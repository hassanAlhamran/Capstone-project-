# Capstone-project-
# 🚦 Traffic Accidents Analysis (2012–2025)
# 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of traffic accidents to identify trends, risk factors, and causes that contribute to road incidents.
Using Python, Excel, and Power BI, the study explores accident patterns across time, location, weather, and road conditions to support data-driven strategies for improving road safety.

# 🎯 Objectives

Analyze accident frequency across years (2018–2019) and time of day (AM/PM).

Identify common causes such as driver errors, road types, and lighting conditions.

Examine environmental factors (weather, surface, visibility) affecting crash severity.

Evaluate accident severity (fatal, serious, minor, no injury) by crash type and location.

Develop interactive visual dashboards for insights and awareness.

# 🧠 Key Insights

Accidents increased over the years, peaking during evening hours.

Most crashes occurred on dry roads under daylight, yet were still mostly non-fatal but costly.

Driver errors and undivided roads were primary contributors to collisions.

Reinforcing lane discipline and driver awareness can significantly reduce risks.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

Total Accidents by Year and Time – shows accident frequency trends (AM/PM).

Accident Severity Distribution – compares no-injury vs fatal cases.

Top Contributing Causes – human, environmental, and road factors.

Weather & Lighting Impact – identifies high-risk environmental conditions.

## 🔍 Limitations

Dataset limited to specific city records.

Missing values in some environmental and cause columns.

Lacks real-time GPS or vehicle-type data for advanced modeling.

## 💡 Recommendations

Strengthen traffic monitoring during PM peak hours.

Improve safety at intersections and undivided roads.

Launch awareness programs for safe driving under normal daylight conditions.

Enforce stricter traffic laws to reduce repeated offenses and fatalities.
